# ActionScript & MXML for Visual Studio Code Changelog

## 1.11.1

### Fixed Issues

Build: Fixed issue where multiple Quick Compile & Debug/Run commands could be run simultaneously. Now, you must wait for one to complete before starting a new one.
Build: Fixed issue where Adobe AIR packaging tasks were incorrectly provided for _.swc_ library projects.
Documentation: Fixed failure to remove uppercase HTML tags from rendered text.
Documentation: Fixed line breaks missing between some block-level elements.
Documentation: Fixed missing formatting for list items.
Documentation: Fixed display of HTML entities in code blocks.
General: Fixed wrong Apache Royale version number in error message about invalid `as3mxml.sdk.editor` values.
General: The thread to watch source paths is a daemon to avoid it blocking the language server from exiting.

## 1.11.0

### New Features

Build: Added a number of new compiler options for Apache Royale to the `compilerOptions` section of _asconfig.json_, meaning that many advanced options no longer need to be added to `additionalOptions`.
Hover: Documentation is now detected in SDKs that store it in resource bundle _.swc_ files separately from the _.swc_ files containing compiled code. More documentation from the Adobe and Apache Flex SDKs should now be shown in hover, completion, and signature help.

### Fixed Issues

Build: Fixed issue where module and worker _.swf_ files were not automatically included in Adobe AIR bundles.
Build: Fixed issue where cleaning the project sometimes would not clean module _.swf_ files.
General: Fixed an issue with detection of changes to _.swc_ library files that caused the workspace to continue using stale APIs.
Settings: Fixed validation of relative framework SDK paths on Windows.
Settings: Fixed issue where changing certain settings sometimes failed to restart the language server.
Hover: Fixed missing asdoc documentation for members of interfaces.
Hover: Fixed missing asdoc documentation for APIs in the public-like `AS3` namespace.
Hover: Fixed missing asdoc documentation for `[Style]` and `[Event]` metadata in _.swc_ libraries.
Hover: Fixed missing asdoc documentation for accessors when the asdoc comment was added to the setter instead of the getter.
Imports: Fixed issue where a class outside of the package block had an import for the class inside the package block, and it was incorrectly removed when organizing imports.
Views: Fixed exception in ActionScript Source Paths view when the project has no source paths yet.

## 1.10.0

### New Features

- General: SDK path is no longer required to be absolute. It may be specified relative to the workspace root folder, or relative to the _.code-workspace_ file, for multi-root workspaces.
- Imports: When completing an override of a function, types of parameters and return are now automatically imported, if possible.

### Fixed Issues

- Completion: Fixed intermittent string range exception when completing imports.
- General: Fixed watching of individual _.swc_ files in `library-path` or `external-library-path`, and not only directories of _.swc_ files.

## 1.9.0

### Fixed Issues

- General: Fixed issue that prevented the language server from running with a socket instead of standard input.
- General: The language server automatically exits as soon as the input stream from the parent process closes. This should help prevent zombie processes from staying open after closing Visual Studio Code.

### Other Changes

- Dependencies: Apache Royale compiler updated to v0.9.8.

## 1.8.0

### New Features

- Code Generation: Smarter detection of underscore (`_`) characters at the beginning of the original variable. The undercore is added to the backing variable, if missing. It is removed from the getter and setter, if present.
- Completion: Can now suggest methods to override after only the `override` keyword (previously, you needed to specify both the `override` and `function` keywords and the namespace to get suggestions). Also, lists getters and setters that may be overridden.
- Settings: New setting `as3mxml.sources.organizeImports.addMissingImports` determines whether missing imports are added when the organize imports command is run.
- Settings: New setting `as3mxml.sources.organizeImports.removeUnusedImports` determines whether unused imports are removed when the organize imports command is run.
- Settings: New setting `as3mxml.sources.organizeImports.insertNewLineBetweenTopLevelPackages` determines of an extra new line is added between top-level packages when the organize imports command is run.

### Fixed Issues

- General: Fixed issue where code intelligence could freeze if the same _asconfig.json_ file appeared in multiple workspace root folders.
- Hover: Fixed resolution of symbols when they are fully-qualified with the package name.
- Organize Imports: Fixed issue where imports where sometimes moved to the top of an _.mxml_ file instead of remaining at the top of the `<fx:Script>` section.
- Quick Compile & Run/Debug: Fixed issue where pressing Enter while Ctrl+F searching could fail after running Quick Compile & Run/Debug because the output channel would not release focus.

### Other Changes

- Rename and Find References: Optimized performance by skipping most files in the project when finding/renaming private symbols.
- Dependencies: eclipse/lsp4j language server updated to v0.12.0.

## 1.7.1

### Fixed Issues

- Build: Fixed missing Adobe AIR build tasks.

## 1.7.0

### New Features

- Code Actions: Added new `as3mxml.codeGeneration.getterSetter.forcePublicFunctions` and `as3mxml.codeGeneration.getterSetter.forcePrivateVariable` settings to customize how the generate getter and setter quick fixes behave.

### Fixed Issues

- Build: Fixed issue where captive runtime and native installer builds were debug instead of release.
- Code Actions: Fixed missing "Add import" code actions for classes in _.swc_ libraries.
- Completion: Fixed wrong namespace in Apache Flex projects when adding the root tag with the MX namespace to an _.mxml_ file.
- Hover: Fixed missing mouse hover text for custom user namespaces.
- Syntax: Missing syntax coloring for namespace declarations.

## 1.6.0

### New Features

- Build: Added new `workers` field in _asconfig.json_ to compile worker SWFs with an application project.
- Build: Added support for `resdir` in `airOptions` section of _asconfig.json_ to support HARMAN's latest SDK.
- Code Actions: Suggests imports for package-level variables or functions when a symbol is unrecognized (not just classes and interfaces).
- Import: Workers are now included when importing an Adobe Flash Builder project.

### Fixed Issues

- Build: No longer deletes root output folder when cleaning the project. This change is to more closely match the behavior of other IDEs.
- Import: Fixed issue where an Adobe Flash Builder project for Adobe AIR might be detected as targeting desktop instead of mobile, in some cases.
- Import: Fixed issue where an Adobe Flash Builder project could not be successfully imported if the folder also contained a FlashDevelop project.

### Other changes

- Dependencies: eclipse/lsp4j language server updated to v0.10.0.

## v1.5.0

### New Features

- Build: The `additionalOptions` field in _asconfig.json_ files may optionally be specified as an array of strings, instead of a single string.
- Settings: A new `as3mxml.languageServer.concurrentRequests` setting may be set to `false` to disable spawning a thread for each request to the ActionScript & MXML code intelligence. This may result in a more stable environment, in some cases.
- Views: The ActionScript Source Paths view now displays source paths for all open projects (not just the first).

### Fixed Issues

- General: Fixed issue where source files on case-insensitive file systems might not be associated with the correct project, resulting in limited code intelligence.
- Problems: Fixed issue where some errors were not displayed if certain compiler options were misconfigured.

## v1.4.0

### New Features

- Build: Support for compiling Apache Flex modules.
- Project Import: Modules in Adobe Flash Builder projects are now included.

### Fixed Issues

- Build: Further reduce command line options generated when adding folders to an Adobe AIR application. In some cases, it would make the command too long and the build would fail.
- Build: Add missing action to unpackage Adobe AIR native extensions for debugging when compiling with Adobe Animate.
- Completion: Fix location of added imports in MXML `<fx:Script>` tags when CDATA is missing.

## v1.3.0

### New Features

- Projects: Multiple projects in a single workspace folder. If a workspace folder contains additional _asconfig.json_ files in sub-folders, these will be detected as separate projects. Perfect for projects containing tests and for quickly opening a shared parent folder without manually adding each project as a separate workspace folder.

### Fixed Issues

- Build: Quick compile commands no longer print incorrect "pending" message before initialization when no _asconfig.json_ files are detected.
- General: Fix warning in output console that referenced a _vscode-userdata:_ URI.
- Hover: fix formatting of constructor names to look like `ClassName.com.example.ClassName`.
- Hover: fix missing ASDoc documentation when hovering over symbols in _.mxml_ files.

### Other changes

- General: The ActionScript SDK status bar item is visible only when the active editor contains an _.as_, _.mxml_ or _asconfig.json_ file. This better matches how the TypeScript version status bar item behaves.

## v1.2.2

### Fixed Issues

- Build: Hide Java icon from dock on macOS.
- Code Actions: Fix null exception for errors/warnings that don't have a code.
- Definition: Go to definition works for symbols from _.ane_ files (showing a decompiled stub, similar to _.swc_ files).
- Problems: Fix null exception on file change when real-time problems are disabled.
- Problems: Fix issue where problems might not be cleared for deleted files.
- Tasks: Fix exception when searching for Adobe Animate on Windows, and no Adobe software is installed.
- Tasks: Fix error _The task provider for "actionscript" tasks unexpectedly provided a task of type "animate"._

## v1.2.1

### Fixed Issues

- Settings: Fixed issue where `as3mxml.sdk.animate` setting was not properly handled when using the default value of `null`.

## v1.2.0

### New Features

- Editor: Fades out sections of code that are disabled by conditional compilation.
- Hover: Documentation for native Adobe AIR and Flash Player classes, like `flash.display.Sprite`, is now displayed.
- Hover: Documentation for _.swc_ files that embed the appropriate asdoc XML files is now displayed.
- Hover/Definition: Resolves `this` and `super` to the appropriate class so that some details may be displayed.
- Settings: Added new `as3mxml.languageServer.jvmargs` setting to pass additional arguments to the language server (the code intelligence engine) on startup.
  Example:
  ```json
  {
    "as3mxml.languageServer.jvmargs": "-Xms512m -Xmx1024m"
  }
  ```
- Settings: Added new `as3mxml.sdk.animate` setting to optionally configure a custom path for Adobe Animate if it is installed at a non-standard location.

### Fixed Issues

- Hover: Fixed null pointer exception when hovering over the `void` keyword.

### Other Changes

- Dependencies: Apache Royale compiler updated to v0.9.7.

## v1.1.1

### Fixed Issues

- Problems: Fixed issue where setting both `as3mxml.sdk.framework` and `as3mxml.sdk.editor` to the same SDK would be incorrectly detected as having no SDK configured.

## v1.1.0

### New Features

- Project: Added the `defaults-css-files` compiler option to _asconfig.json_.

### Fixed Issues

- Build: Fixed issue where Adobe AIR files copied into the debug folder did not have the same relative paths as they would when packaging the final application.
- Completion: Fixed issue where completing a property in MXML as a child tag with an existing prefix would incorrectly omit the same prefix from the closing tag.

### Other Changes

- Problems: When the _as3mxml.sdk.framework_ setting is empty, and no SDKs are automatically detected from the environment, the extension no longer displays a pop-up error notification. Instead, the message appears in the problems view when an _.as_ or _.mxml_ file is open, or if an _asconfig.json_ file is present at the root of the workspace.
- Tasks: The extension does not automatically activate when a full list of tasks is requested by VSCode. However, tasks will be provided if the extension is activated in another way, such as when the workspace contains _asconfig.json_ or when an _.as_ or _.mxml_ file is open in an editor.

## v1.0.0

### New Features

- Project: Import projects from FlashDevelop. If you open a folder containing a FlashDevelop project, Visual Studio Code will prompt to convert it to _asconfig.json_.

### Fixed Issues

- Build: Fixed issue where `as3mxml.asconfigc.verboseOutput` setting was ignored when building with Adobe Animate.
- General: Fixed issue where certain compiler options could be incorrectly interpreted as file names, resulting in strange errors.
- General: Fixed issue where an Apache Royale SDK that contains _royale-sdk-description.xml_, but not _flex-sdk-description.xml_, was not considered valid.
- Problems: Fixed issue where wrong path was displayed when `mainClass` was not found.
- Rename: Fixed issue where references were not found inside array `[]` and object `{}` literals.
- Snippets: Fixed issue where for-loop snippet was missing a semi-colon.

### Other Changes

- Build: The `theme` compiler option may now be either a string or an array of strings.
- Build: Added the `include-libraries` compiler option.
- Rename: Optimized renaming a local variable or function inside a method, which previously searched for references in multiple files.

## v0.25.0

### New Features

- Build: Added `aab` as a value for the Adobe AIR `arch` option for Android to support Harman's latest SDK.
- Build: Added `mainClass` field to _asconfig.json_ to optionally use instead of `files`.
  Example:

  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "source-path": ["src"]
    },
    "mainClass": "com.example.Main"
  }
  ```

- Build: Added `extends` field to _asconfig.json_ that may be used to reference another _asconfig_ file to use as a base template while overriding some values.
  For example, you could override the `mainClass` field for a custom build:

  ```json
  {
    "extends": "asconfig.base.json",
    "mainClass": "com.example.MainOverride"
  }
  ```

### Fixed Issues

- Build: Fixed issue where a file not found error could be reported when using `-arch` option when packaging an Adobe AIR application.
- General: Fixed null reference exception in _.mxml_ file when root tag is not found.
- General: Fixed incorrect code intelligence near beginning or end of _.as_ files included with `<fx:Script>` in MXML.
- Syntax: Fixed syntax highlighting issues in MXML for `<fx:Metadata>` and `<fx:Script>` tags that start and end on the same line.
- Tasks: When no target is specified for an Adobe AIR desktop app, tasks list now includes both _captive runtime_ and _shared runtime_ packaging tasks. Previously, it was necessary to specify the `bundle` target.

### Other Changes

- Language Server: Specifying the socket port to use for protocol communication requires the `-Das3mxml.server.port` command line option. Other editors besides Visual Studio Code may need to update their launch command. However, using stdio instead of sockets is recommended.

## v0.24.1

### Fixed Issues

- Dependencies: Fixed dependency on vscode-swf-debug extension that had a typo.

## v0.24.0

### New Features

- Build: Added `x86_64` as a value for the Adobe AIR `arch` option for Android to support Harman's latest SDK.

### Fixed Issues

- Completion: Fixed issue where completion could sometimes be incorrectly disabled because the current code offset was incorrectly detected as being inside a multi-line comment.

### Other Changes

- Debugging: Moved SWF debugger into separate extension, [vscode-swf-debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bowlerhatllc.vscode-swf-debug), and made that a dependency of this extension.

## v0.23.2

### Fixed Issues

- Dependencies: Fixed issue that language server was built with nightly version of the Apache Royale compiler instead of v0.9.6. The nightly version had a bug that caused code intelligence to freeze.

## v0.23.1

### Fixed Issues

- Problems: Fixed issue where an error containing a Java stack trace was sometimes displayed after a _.swc_ file was changed on the file system.
- Problems: Fixed issue where an error containing a Java stack trace was displayed when the `output` compiler option was missing in a library project.
- Problems: Fixed issue where no errors were displayed if certain required compiler options were missing.

## v0.23.0

### New Features

- Build: Added `armv8` as a value for the Adobe AIR `arch` option for Android to support Harman's latest SDK.
- Editor: Improved performance of real-time problem checking, reducing sluggishness in certain files.
- Editor: Fades out unused imports, and new code actions may be used to remove them.
- Editor: Strikes out references to deprecated APIs.
- Problems: Hides compiler errors and warnings for files that are not referenced by the project, unless they are opened in an editor.
  > This change makes Visual Studio Code behave more like other IDEs, such as Adobe Flash Builder, when displaying problems for ActionScript and MXML.

### Fixed Issues

- Build: Fixed issue where the "quick compile" commands could be triggered without an _asconfig.json_ file
- Completion: Fixed issue where functions and variables at a package-level were not included in import completion.
- Editor: Fixed issue where some _asconfig_ files were not validated. Now, if the file name contains a middle token, like _asconfig.production.json_, it will be validated.
- Problems: Fixed issue where warnings were reported without their associated numeric code.
- Syntax: Fixed syntax highlighting issues for function parameter types and return types.

### Other Changes

- Dependencies: Apache Royale compiler updated to v0.9.6.
- Dependencies: eclipse/lsp4j updated to v0.8.0.
- Snippets: Removed snippets for `return` statements, to match Microsoft's removal of similar snippets for JavaScript and TypeScript.

## v0.22.0

### New Features

- Build: The `application` field in _asconfig.json_ can now (optionally) accept an object that references multiple platforms so that each platform may use a different file.
  Example:
  ```json
  {
    "application": {
      "ios": "src/ExampleIOS-app.xml",
      "android": "src/ExampleAndroid-app.xml"
    }
  }
  ```
  You may continue to specify a single Adobe AIR application descriptor for all platforms — just like in previous versions:
  ```json
  {
    "application": "src/Example-app.xml"
  }
  ```
- Settings: Added `as3mxml.asconfigc.jvmargs` setting to pass additional arguments to the Java Virtual Machine when running the compiler.
  Example:
  ```json
  {
    "as3mxml.asconfigc.jvmargs": "-Xms512m -Xmx1024m"
  }
  ```
  This setting may be used to increase performance and fix out of memory errors when compiling, [similar to Adobe Flash Builder](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-builder/kb/sluggish-performance-out-memory-errors.html).
- Settings: Added `as3mxml.asconfigc.verboseOutput` setting to display more detailed output when running a build task. Verbose output includes the full set of options passed to any tools that are run during the build (including the compiler and the Adobe AIR packager).

### Fixed Issues

- Build: Fixed issue where `-sampler`, `-embedBitcode` and `-hideAneLibSymbols` were incorrectly formatted when packaging an Adobe AIR application for iOS.
- Build: Simplified the ADT command when packaging folders into an Adobe AIR application.
- Build: Fixed issue where folders to be packaged in an Adobe AIR app could not be found when building an asconfig.json file that is not in the workspace root (such as when the file is in a sub-folder).
- Build: Fixed issue where the name of the generated Adobe AIR application descriptor was wrong when using a template from the SDK.
- Debug: Fixed issue where SWF workers were not allowed to start in the debugger.
- Tasks: Fixed issue where Adobe AIR packaging tasks were missing if the `airOptions` section were missing in _asconfig.json_, but other fields could be used to detect the Adobe AIR requirement.
- Code Actions: Fixed null reference exception when MXML cannot be parsed.
- Completion: Fixed issue where `//` in a URL namespace was incorrectly detected as a comment when appearing before an MXML attribute.
- Completion: Fixed issue where completing an MXML attribute does not automatically add `=""` if the next character is already `=`.

### Other Changes

- Documentation: Added a page that explains [how to enable ActionScript and MXML code intelligence in Sublime Text](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/vscode-as3mxml/wiki/How-to-use-the-ActionScript-and-MXML-language-server-with-Sublime-Text) by using the language server from this Visual Studio Code extension.

## v0.21.0

### New Features

- Editor: Enabled partial code intelligence for open files that come from outside of the workspace's source path. This includes SDK framework classes, and _.as_ and _.mxml_ files that are opened when no workspace folder is open in Visual Studio Code.
- Settings: Added `as3mxml.problems.showFileOutsideSourcePath` setting to disable the informational message that is displayed when an open _.as_ or _.mxml_ file is not in the workspace's source path.

### Fixed Issues

- Code Actions: Fixed issue where a null reference exception could be thrown if the line number and indent could not be discovered.
- Completion: Fixed issue where completing a method incorrectly added `()` when the next character in the file is already `(`.
- Debugger: Fixed issue where port forwarding for connected devices was not cleaned up if the connection to the debugger times out.
- Syntax: Fixed issue where comments inside function signature parameters were not colored correctly.
- Syntax: Fixed issue where parameter types containing numbers were not colored correctly.

### Other Changes

- Build: Activating a "quick compile" command before the language server initializes now queues it up for later, instead of displaying an error message. After initialization, the queued compile command will be re-attempted.
- Language Server: Consolidated the `TextDocumentService` and `WorkspaceService` implementations into a single `ActionScriptServices` class. Custom language servers that extend the old `ActionScriptTextDocumentService` or `ActionScriptWorkspaceService` will need to extend the new class instead.

## v0.20.0

### New Features

- Code Action: Added ability to generate an event listener from an `addEventListener()` call.
- Completion: When completing a method name, automatically adds parentheses, moves the cursor between them, and activates signature help.
- SWF Debugger: Supports breakpoints in _.hx_ files.
- SWF Debugger: Classes and other global objects may be added to the **Watch** panel to see static variables and constants.

### Fixed Issues

- Build: Fixed slowdown in v0.19 caused by fixes for `copySourcePathAssets` and read-only files.
- Build: Fixed issues parsing `additionalOptions` in _asconfig.json_ and consolidated parsing code so that it is consistent between builds and code intelligence.
- Build: Added missing `keep-all-type-selectors` and `show-unused-type-selectors` to `compilerOptions`.
- Editor: Fixed issue where contents of `<fx:Style>` and `<mx:Style>` were not treated as CSS for some actions, such as toggling comments.
- General: Fixed issue where code intelligence for items in a `Vector` was not available when accessed by index. For example, the `alpha` property in `vec[0].alpha` is now properly resolved by code intelligence.
- Rename: Fixed issue where rename symbol failed.
- Signature Help: Fixed issue where signature help was not available in MXML data binding and events.
- SWF Debugger: Fixed issue where static variables and constants were displayed on an instance when paused at a breakpoint. To see static variables now, add the class to the **Watch** panel.

### Other Changes

- The minimum supported version of Visual Studio Code is now 1.34.0.
- eclipse/lsp4j dependency updated to v0.7.1.
- Refactoring: Major refactor to make the AS3 & MXML language server easier to maintain and more approachable to new contributors. Extracted most features out into their own separate classes.
- Changed Visual Studio Code's language identifier for ActionScript from `"nextgenas"` to `"actionscript"`. Most people will not be affected by this change, but if your _settings.json_ contains a `"[nextgenas]"` section, you will need to change that to `"[actionscript]"` instead.

### Tips & Tricks

- To generate an event listener, call `addEventListener()` with the name of a method that doesn't exist yet:
  ```actionscript
  target.addEventListener(Event.CHANGE, changeHandler);
  ```
  Place the cursor inside the method name, and click the light bulb 💡 icon that appears (or use the `Ctrl+.` keyboard shortcut). Choose _Generate Event Listener_ from the drop down.
- In the SWF debugger, to see the static variables and constants defined on a class, you can add the fully-qualified class name to the **Watch** panel. If the class is in a package, be sure to separate the package and class with the `::` operator. For example, you might add `flash.events::Event` to see all of the static constants defined on this class.

## v0.19.0

### New Features

- Tasks: New tasks to compile and publish with Adobe Animate.
- Debug: If a _.fla_ file is defined in _asconfig.json_, the `Ctrl+Enter` or `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` keyboard shortcuts will launch Adobe Animate and run either **Test Movie** or **Debug Movie**.
- Code Actions: Added **Implement interface** code action to implement missing methods.
- Go to Definition: Opens external files referenced by `<fx:Script source="file.as"/>`.
- Go to Definition: Opens external files referenced by `<fx:Style source="file.css"/>`.
- Editor: Syntax in _.jsfl_ files is now highlighted as JavaScript.

### Fixed Issues

- Problems: Fixed issue where deleting _asconfig.json_ would not clear existing configuration errors.
- Editor: Fixed issue where Java exceptions appeared in the console when the file path for a `<fx:Script source="file.as">` tag could not be found.
- Project: Fixed issue where importing a Flash Builder project did not resolve tokens for custom linked resources in the Eclipse workspace.
- Build: Fixed issue where `copySourcePathAssets` could fail when a file is read-only.
- Build: Fixed issue where `copySourcePathAssets` sometimes copied the same file to the output folder more than once.
- Build: Fixed compiler failure in large projects by increasing the max heap size for the JVM.

### Other Changes

- Quick Compile & Debug: The `Ctrl+Enter` keyboard shortcut now starts without debugging, and `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` should be used instead to debug. This change is to make the behavior more consistent with the new Adobe Animate integration.

## v0.18.0

### New Features

- Project: Import projects from Adobe Flash Builder. If you open a folder containing a Flash Builder project, Visual Studio Code will prompt to convert it to _asconfig.json_.
- Go To Definition: When a definition is in a SWC file, the generated/decompiled text that is opened in an editor now includes more details, including metadata and some constant values. Additionally, members of classes are now sorted, and custom namespaces are formatted better.
- Hover: Constants are now shown with their values, if the value is primitive, like a `String`, `Boolean`, or `Number`.
- Quick Compile & Debug: All files are saved before compiling, matching the default behavior in Visual Studio Code when running a build task.
- Build: Added support for `directory`, `load-externs` and `include-file` compiler options to `compilerOptions` field in _asconfig.json_.
- General: Added `as3mxml.problems.realTime` setting. When set to `false`, problems will be reported on save only.
- Build: The `application` field in _asconfig.json_ is now optional. If the SDK contains a template for an Adobe AIR application descriptor, this file will be automatically copied to the output folder and populated with some simple defaults.

### Fixed Issues

- Build: Fixed issue where clean command resulted in a null reference exception if main file was in the root folder of the workspace.
- Completion: Fixed missing qualified name in package-level functions that made it difficult to differentiate between functions with the same name.
- SWF Debugger: Fixed issue where the call stack might link to a file that doesn't exist in the current SDK.
- General: Fixed some concurrency issues that would sometimes require a restart of the language server.
- General: Fixed some issues related to the ActionScript `include` statement and MXML `<fx:Script source="script.as"/>`.
- Hover: Fixed issue where hover pop-up for `void` and `Object` types incorrectly displayed the `extends` keyword with no superclass.
- Problems: Fixed null reference exception if a compiler problem had no offset position.
- Problems: Fixed issue where problems were not updated properly when an open file that wasn't originally on the `source-path` gets added to the `source-path` later.

### Other Changes

- The `$nextgenas_nomatch` problem matcher in _tasks.json_ is now considered deprecated. Use an empty array instead:
  ```
  "problemMatchers": []
  ```
- General: JavaScript code in the extension is now bundled/minified with Webpack to speed up start-up time and reduce download size.

## v0.17.2

### Fixed Issues

- Build: Fixed issue where multiple values in the `include-classes` compiler option were not passed to the compiler correctly.
- Build: Fixed issue where formatting perfectly valid options in `additionalOptions` in a certain way could cause compiles to fail.
- Completion: Fixed issue where ActionScript imports added in MXML were added to the beginning of the file when it contains no `<fx:Script>` element yet.
- General: Fixed issue where code intelligence might hang with if certain invalid compiler options are specified. On startup, the issue caused the "Initializing ActionScript & MXML language server..." message in the status bar to get stuck.

## v0.17.1

### Fixed Issues

- Completion: Fixed issue where completion _still_ did not work in an empty MXML file when using Flex as the workspace SDK.

## v0.17.0

### New Features

- Debug: A _launch.json_ file is no longer required to launch the SWF debugger. If _launch.json_ is missing, and you start a debugging session, you can choose _SWF_, and the extension will choose reasonable defaults based on your project's _asconfig.json_.
- Debug: ANEs are detected in _asconfig.json_ and automatically unpackaged for debugging in the Adobe AIR simulator. It is no longer necessary to unpackage ANEs manually.
- Debug: The `extdir` and `profile` fields for SWF debugging in _launch.json_ are populated automatically based on your project's _asconfig.json_.
- Completion: MXML completion now provides enumeration values for properties with `[Inspectable]` metadata and styles.

### Fixed Issues

- Build: Fixed the clean task when used in an Apache Royale project with the default output folder.
- Build: Fixed the formatting for the `namespace` compiler option because it was failing in some situations.
- Build: Fixed issue where some files could not be copied to the output folder when creating a debug build for the Adobe AIR simulator.
- Completion: Fixed issue where completion did not work in an empty MXML file. Now provides all components and will insert appropriate MXML namespaces.
- Completion: Fixed issue where the 2006 MXML namespace might be incorrectly chosen for certain components when the 2009 MXML namespace was already included in the file.
- Completion: Fixed issue where MXML completion would not provide types for children of Flex MX containers.
- General: Fixed issue where the `include-namespaces` compiler option was not validated correctly in _asconfig.json_.

### Other Changes

- Build: Added missing `js-load-config` and `js-define` compiler options.
- Debug: Migrated from Visual Studio Code's deprecated `adapterExecutableCommand` to `DebugAdapterDescriptorFactory`.
- Advanced: SDKs may include a file named _ide/vscode-as3mxml/vscode-as3mxml-config.xml_ to configure the extension with their own default compiler options.
- Commands: Added new `as3mxml.saveSessionPassword` command that may be used when packaging an Adobe AIR Application. See _Tips & Tricks_ below for an example.

### Tips & Tricks

- You can now save your Adobe AIR code signing password for the current session. A new `as3mxml.saveSessionPassword` command may be called from a custom task:
  ```json
  {
    "label": "package Adobe AIR app (Android)",
    "type": "shell",
    "command": "asconfigc",
    "args": [
      "--sdk=${config:as3mxml.sdk.framework}",
      "--debug=false",
      "--air=android",

- Tasks: Removed deprecated command "Tasks: Configure Task Runner (ActionScript - asconfig.json)". Use **Configure Default Build Task** in **Tasks** menu instead.
- Tasks: If the Adobe AIR desktop target is set to "native" in _asconfig.json_ the list of tasks will specifically mention which tasks will package a native installer.
- Workspace Symbols: Fixed issue where an exception was displayed when listing workspace symbols and a SWC file in the SDK contains resource bundles.

## 0.10.0

### New Features

- Build: _asconfig.json_ may optionally include `${flexlib}` token in paths specified in the compiler options. This token will be replaced with the path to the _frameworks_ directory of the current SDK. For Apache Royale projects, the `${royalelib}` token is available instead.

- Replaced "NextGen ActionScript" icon with a new "AS3" icon.
- SWF debugger: If a source file is not found when trying to add a breakpoint, tries again later when more scripts are loaded. If breakpoints start out unverified, it's possible that they will be verified later when the SWF goes to a new frame.
- SWF debugger: Fixed issue where breakpoints removed in editor were not actually removed in running SWF and would still stop the debugger.
- SWF debugger: Begins executing SWF earlier because breakpoints can now be verified after startup. This may allow preloaders to render properly now (they skipped immediately to the end before).
- Searching workspace symbols simplified to exclude local variables in methods.
- Fixed issue where automatically adding an import would fail if the ActionScript file contained a license header or other comments before the package keyword.
- Fixed issue where some errors caused by invalid compiler options might not be displayed in the problems view.
