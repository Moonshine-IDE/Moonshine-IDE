## Moonshine IDE [2.3.0]

### Summary

Moonshine 2.3.0 now has support for Java Maven and Gradle projects.   You can import external Java projects, and Moonshine will use the existing pom.xml or build.gradle to build the project and determine the dependencies.

In addition, we added initial support for Grails projects. Currently you can create and run new projects, and the projects have limited language server support.  We will add more functionality in the next release.

### Added
* Import Java Gradle and Maven projects
* Moonshine will load the Java project dependencies from pom.xml or build.gradle.  The classpath is determined by the build scripts only.  For Gradle projects, you can force the dependencies to update to the classpath with Project > Refresh Gradle Classpath.
* Create Grails projects
* Moonshine SDK Installer will now install the Gradle and Grails SDKs

### Changed
* The **Reference** window from View > Find References has been moved to the console area.
* The default repository entries from the previous release can now be restored with Help > Restore Default Dependencies
* New > File will now create a file with an arbitrary extension in any project type.
* Added validation for manually setting SDK paths
* File choosers will now automatically open to the last used path when possible.

### Fixed
* Code Editor: Fixed issue where selecting text in a Java project caused exceptions on focus change
* Fixed issue where some project templates were missing in the Home tab.
* Fixed issue where modifications to the project templates were ignored when creating new projects.
* Fixed issue where Getting Started entries did not update their status when set manually by the user.
* Fixed issue where opening the same project more than once created multiple language server instances


## Moonshine IDE [2.2.0]

### Summary

This release was focused on adding Git support in the Manage Repositories interface from 2.1.0.  You may now clone and track Git repositories in this interface.  To help new users get started, we have added a few example repositories to the interface by default.  This includes the Moonshine source and some examples for Apache Royale.

We also made some changes to make it faster to clone complicated projects.  Moonshine will now automatically detect subprojects within a repository, and prompt the user to decide which projects to open.  In addition, we added a feature to allow repositories to define links to other repositories with moonshine-dependencies.xml.   For example, Moonshine-IDE provides links to all of its external dependencies, so that you can clone all required projects without leaving Moonshine or reviewing a README file.  This file may be added to other repositories using the format defined [here](https://github.com/prominic/Moonshine-IDE/wiki/Link-Related-Projects-with-moonshine-dependencies.xml).

### Added
* Added support to define related repositories for an SVN or Git repository, using moonshine-dependencies.xml.  See the documentation [here](https://github.com/prominic/Moonshine-IDE/wiki/Link-Related-Projects-with-moonshine-dependencies.xml).
* If a cloned or checked out repository contains multiple subprojects (like https://github.com/prominic/Moonshine-IDE.git), Moonshine will allow the user to automatically open the subprojects (up to 3 levels deep).
* Added [Apache Royale](https://royale.apache.org/) Jewel project template.  This requires a [nightly build (0.9.6)](http://apacheroyaleci.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com:8080/job/royale-asjs_jsonly/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/out/) of Apache Royale.

### Changed
* Added support for Git in the Manage Repositories interface.
* Provide non-sandbox version of Moonshine for Mac users.
* Visual Editor: Allow search **Code** tab using menu option **Edit** -> **Find**.

### Fixed
* Fixed issue where Browse All repository threw an error when the repository list was empty. 
* Templates: Fixed issue where modifying a template triggered an exception 

#### Known Issue
* Template modifications will not be applied to new projects.
* The Jewel template for Apache Royale requires the latest [nightly build (0.9.6)](http://apacheroyaleci.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com:8080/job/royale-asjs_jsonly/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/out/) which is not currently available with Moonshine SDK Installer

### Notable Known issues

#### https://github.com/prominic/Moonshine-IDE/issues/36
While testing for this release, we noticed that most browsers were blocking the user from opening SWFs from their local filesystem.  The browsers will show a message like "To view this page ensure that Adobe Flash Player version 16.0.0 or greater is installed." and a "Get ADOBE FLASH PLAYER" button.

For most browsers, if you click the button, the browser will prompt you about whether you would like to allow the SWF to run.  After you allow this, you can run the SWF normally.  However, Firefox will direct you to a download page instead, so you may want to test in other browsers for now..  

Alternatively, you can bypass the above errors by deploying the generated SWF to a local or remote server.
